        Start by browsing listings of available loan opportunities, choosing one or more that you would like to fund.
        You can make a bid for any portion of the loan and choose your own interest rate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the loan is fully funded and the borrower confirms acceptance, we disburse 100% of your funds to the borrower.
        In the meantime, you can communicate with the borrower via the Comment Forum in each loan profile.
    </p>
    <p>
        The repayment of your loan occurs in weekly or monthly installments.
        As soon as the borrower makes a repayment, we credit the funds back to your lender account.
        The repaid funds can be withdrawn at any time, or you can reinvest the money in new loans to other borrowers.
